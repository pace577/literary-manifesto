  A lot of us are busy at different times in the semester. I have observed that many of you are interested in essay-writing, debates, JAMs, and want to participate in events/competitions held in the institute, but your academic schedule doesn&rsquo;t accommodate your interests. What if you can organize an event yourself, however and whenever you like?
With guidance from a literary affairs council member, any student in the institute will be able to organize an event with their own rules, with the date and topic/theme/language of their choice.

  To me, writing isn&rsquo;t just a means for communication. It&rsquo;s a tool for retrospection, a mechanism for change. Words have the power to connect like minded people. And the best part is when the reader comes back and talks to you about what you wrote! I used to write stories and articles but end up not sharing them publicly. That ended with Udaan, and now I think I&rsquo;ll keep sharing the pieces I write.

  This is not just a manifesto but also an evolving list of ideas, which means that new ideas are added, outdated ideas are scrapped, and all progress about it&rsquo;s implementation is continuously updated. I chose a website over other alternatives as there is high potential for customizability, and we have no shortage of techies in our institute! I encourage everyone who likes this idea to make use of it yourself, and improve on it if possible!

  I am Prabhat, a third year undergraduate student from the Electrical Engineering department (Batch of 2018). I am contesting for the post of Literary affairs secretary (LAS) in the Student Elections 2021-22 and this is my manifesto.
Intention The executive wing has done a very good job over the years in developing a literary environment in our college. We have a debating club, a quizzing club, a film club, a student newsletter, a good set of leisure reading books in the library, along with multiple literary events with prizes held around the year.
