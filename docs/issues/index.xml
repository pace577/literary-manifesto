      <description>A lot of us are busy at different times in the semester. I have observed that many of you are interested in essay-writing, debates, JAMs, and want to participate in events/competitions held in the institute, but your academic schedule doesn&amp;rsquo;t accommodate your interests. What if you can organize an event yourself, however and whenever you like?
With guidance from a literary affairs council member, any student in the institute will be able to organize an event with their own rules, with the date and topic/theme/language of their choice.</description>

      <title>More than a Manifesto</title>

      <description>This is not just a manifesto but also an evolving list of ideas, which means that new ideas are added, outdated ideas are scrapped, and all progress about it&amp;rsquo;s implementation is continuously updated. I chose a website over other alternatives as there is high potential for customizability, and we have no shortage of techies in our institute! I encourage everyone who likes this idea to make use of it yourself, and improve on it if possible!</description>
