This is the manifesto page. For those who are interested in my previous work, [this page](/about-me) describes some of it briefly. To know why the manifesto is on a web page, read [this](/issues/1-manifesto-website).

## Introduction
I believe honesty takes precedence over diplomacy here, so please allow me to be a little informal. There are a few changes that I want to establish, but I'm expecting most of the ideas to come from you all (We all are students of IITT after all!). My role would be to give these ideas a shape and facilitate the execution of these ideas.

The executive wing has done a very good job over the years in developing a literary environment in our college. We have a debating club, a quizzing club, a film club, a student newsletter, a good set of leisure reading books in the library, along with multiple literary events with prizes held around the year. My intention is to fine tune these establishments further, and introduce events to encourage participation and enable people to hone their skills on various literary fronts.

## Things I guarantee will happen
I don't want to make guarantees pertaining to literary events that I can't fulfill. The pandemic situation is dynamic, and I think we too should be quick on our feet and grab opportunities as soon as we can. The following is my list of guarantees:

- Conduct a whole lot of literary events!
  The aim is to conduct events for everyone - all possible languages, themes
- Bring more opportunities for participation in outside events.
- Improve the online presence for the Debate and Quiz clubs.
- More variety of literary events. Language specific events maybe, or something else.
- We need a lot of volunteers. (Mention the lack of volunteers in the manifesto. Appeal to people to join)
- Maintain transparency and accountability by keeping track of all the work done and regularly update them in a [website](/issues/1-manifesto-website).

## Things I will work for
- Establish a literary club to build a community of readers, writers, poets and anyone interested in any form of literature, to share knowledge and get better together.
- Take as many ideas as possible and implement as many of them as possible!
- Bring together a design team for making posters and logos for clubs and various events.
  Debate club needs a LOGO. We can have a design team to create logos, organize content post on insta. This design team can guide the clubs.
- Provide opportunities to any interested student to conduct events. Read more about this [here](/issues/2-decentralized-events).
  
These ideas are definitely implementable but would be very difficult to realize without support from you. This is 

## Why vote for me?
<!-- Because I'm determined and open-minded.  -->

## About me
I'm fond of writing, and I'm even more fond of working with people and getting things done.

I've been observing the state of literary activities over time and while people have worked very hard to get them to the state they are now, there is still a lot of room for improvement, low volume of participation in events and the lack of a literary club being a few of them. Being a part of the newsletter committee and participating in debating and quizzing events, I believe I can help things get better.

## Thank you
These are ideas out in the open for *anyone* to use. I came up with some of them, some were collected when talking to other people. I think these are good ideas, but there is always room for improvement. In fact there's a whole lot of room for a whole lot of diverse ideas!

I'm fond of words, but what I'm even more fond of, is to work with people and get things done. This is
