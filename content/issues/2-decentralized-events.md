A lot of us are busy at different times in the semester. I have observed that many of you are interested in essay-writing, debates, JAMs, and want to participate in events/competitions held in the institute, but your academic schedule doesn't accommodate your interests. What if you can organize an event yourself, however and whenever you like?

With guidance from a literary affairs council member, any student in the institute will be able to organize an event with their own rules, with the date and topic/theme/language of their choice. 

This sounds simple, but really isn't. It needs a systematic procedure for everything to go smoothly, which I plan to establish after good amount of thought and consultation.
