This is not just a *manifesto* but also an evolving list of ideas, which means that new ideas are added, outdated ideas are scrapped, and all progress about it's implementation is continuously updated. I chose a website over other alternatives as there is high potential for customizability, and we have no shortage of techies in our institute! I encourage everyone who likes this idea to make use of it yourself, and improve on it if possible! If anyone wants to put up a similar site for their uses, you can access its source code [here](https://github.com/pace577/literary-manifesto).

## Why a website?
The intention is to maintain **transparency** and **accountability** i.e. transparency in the work done and accountability of people in charge of the work. 

### Transparency
The student representatives have undertaken a lot of initiatives for the betterment of the institute over the years. Some of them worked well, while some failed, but none of this is known to a lot of students in the institute. I want to attempt to bridge the communication gap by means of this website, by listing all initiatives as *issues* and maintaining a *status log* (indicating the progress) for each issue.

### Accountability
Let's be honest, not everyone in the secretaries' council works hard. It might not be their fault, they might be caught up with academics or stuck in a bad pandemic situation or might've just lost interest. That is completely reasonable, but what is not acceptable is the lack of communication. If someone is in charge of something, it is good practice to regularly update the status of work. If he/she is unable to continue working, it's good to let others know about that so something can be done to fix the situation.

How does a website fit in all of this? The idea is to increase accountability by means of communication. The following is the structure of an issue page.
- The name of the person in charge of the issue is mentioned in every issue page.
- The status of the issue (i.e. "In progress", "Not started") is mentioned on every page.
- Updates on an active issue must be updated on a weekly basis.

The person that is responsible for the issue is required to keep thier issue page up to date. By doing so, we can increase accountability and ignite a sense of responsibility.
