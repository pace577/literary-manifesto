To me, writing isn't just a means for communication. It's a tool for retrospection, a mechanism for change. Words have the power to connect like minded people. And the best part is when the reader comes back and talks to you about what you wrote!
I used to write stories and articles but end up not sharing them publicly. That ended with Udaan, and now I think I'll keep sharing the pieces I write.

I'm fond of ideas, and I believe they're of no use if they're alone with me. So I decided to put them out. If I don't manage to become the Literary Affairs Secretary, anyone is welcome to use and implement these ideas. But if I do, I certainly won't be restricted to these ideas. I'm all about working together and realizing ideas, so if you have a good idea then come to me and we'll figure things out!

After reading this, you might say "Oh all that sounds good Prabhat, but why should I believe what you say?". That's a perfectly reasonable thought to have, but if you had that thought, then it's very likely that you don't know me personally. You can contact me via mail (ee18b022@iittp.ac.in) or phone (7032258200 - I prefer Signal, but I'm available on WhatsApp as well). 

Here's a list of my contributions to the institute.
