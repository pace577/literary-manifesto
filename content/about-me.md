To me, writing isn't just a means for communication. It's a tool for retrospection, a mechanism for change. Words have the power to connect like minded people. And the best part is when the reader comes back and talks to you about what you wrote!
I used to write stories and articles but end up not sharing them publicly. That ended with Udaan, and now I think I'll keep sharing the pieces I write.

After reading the manifesto, you might say "Oh, all that sounds good Prabhat, but why should I believe what you say?". That's a perfectly reasonable thought to have, but if you had that thought, then it's very likely that you don't know me personally. You can contact me via the following means.
- Mail (ee18b022@iittp.ac.in)
- Phone (7032258200 - I prefer Signal, but I'm available on WhatsApp as well). 

Here's a list of my contributions to the institute.

- Co-Editor, Udaan, Student Newsletter of IITT.
