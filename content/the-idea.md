This is an *evolving manifesto*, which means that new ideas are added, outdated ideas are scrapped, and all progress is continuously updated. I chose a website over other alternatives as there is high potential for customizability, and we have no shortage of techies in our institute! The source code of this site is available here, and if anyone wants to put up a similar site for their uses, feel free to fork the site repository.

## Why a website?
The intention is to maintain **transparency** and **accountability** i.e. transparency in the work done and accountability of people incharge of the work. 

### Accountability
Let's be honest, not everyone in the secretaries' council work hard. It might not be their fault, they might be caught up with academics or stuck in a bad pandemic situation or they might've just lost interest. That is completely perceivable, but what is not acceptable is the lack of communication. If someone is in charge of something, it is good practice to regularly update the status of work. If he/she is unable to continue working, it's good to let others know about that so something can be done to fix the situation.

How does a website fit in all of this? Here's how I see it
